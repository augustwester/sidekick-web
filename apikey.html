            <h1>How to Get an API Key</h1>
            <p>In order to use Sidekick, you need to
            <ol>
                <li>Enable billing on your OpenAI account</li>
                <li>Create a unique API key</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are no costs associated with this until you start using the app. You only pay for what you use, which (as of this writing) is $0.002 / 1K tokens. To put this into perspective, this means that you can exchange ~2500 pages of text for $2. This is much more than most people will use in the course of many months.</p>
            <p>There are no hidden fees, and the developer of Sidekick does not profit in any way from use of the app.</p>
            <h2>1. Enable billing</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to your <a href="https://platform.openai.com/overview" target="_blank">OpenAI account</a>.</li>
                <li>In the upper right-hand corner, click <b>Personal</b> then <b>Manage account</b></li>
                <li>In the left side of the screen, select <b>Billing</b> and choose <b>Set up paid account</b></li>
                <li>Follow the instructions to enable billing</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>2. Create API key</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In the left side of the screen, select <b>API keys</b></li>
                <li>Choose <b>Create new secret key</b></li>
                <li>Enter the name of your key (e.g. “Sidekick”)</li>
                <li>Copy the key</li>
